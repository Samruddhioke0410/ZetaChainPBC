Technical Specification: ZetaChain Aptos Gateway

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Gateway Contract
The gateway contract serves as the primary interface for cross-chain operations on the Aptos blockchain.

#### Key Components:
- State Management
- Event System
- Token Handling
- Message Processing

### 2. Cross-Chain Communication Flow
1. User initiates transaction on Aptos
2. Gateway processes and validates transaction
3. ZetaChain observes and relays messages
4. Destination chain receives and processes transaction

### 3. Security Model
- Access Control
- Rate Limiting
- Emergency Controls
- Validation Mechanisms
